The task outlined in the PDF you provided involves several steps to process a digital signal using MATLAB. Here's a detailed breakdown of what you need to do:

### 1. Define the Input Signal
The input signal is defined as:
\[ x(t) = \sin(2\pi \times 200 \times t) + \cos(2\pi \times 2000 \times t) \]
This signal consists of two components with frequencies of 200 Hz and 2,000 Hz.

### 2. Sampling
The original sampling rate given is 5,000 Hz. 

### 3. Resampling
You are required to resample this signal at a new rate, which is \( \frac{5}{4} \) times the original rate. The new sampling rate would be:
\[ \text{New Sampling Rate} = 5000 \times \frac{5}{4} = 6250 \, \text{Hz} \]

### 4. Filtering
After resampling, you need to design and apply a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1,000 Hz. This filter will remove the higher frequency components that may have been affected by the resampling process.

### 5. Analysis of Aliasing Effects
You should discuss potential aliasing effects due to the increase in sampling rate without adequate filtering before resampling. Aliasing occurs when higher frequency signals are misinterpreted at lower frequencies, which might be a significant concern given the original high frequency component (2,000 Hz) in your signal.

### 6. Comparison in Time and Frequency Domains
Finally, you should compare the original and processed signals in both the time and frequency domains. This will illustrate the effects of your resampling and filtering process, highlighting differences and potential distortions or losses of information.

### MATLAB Implementation Tips
Hereâ€™s how you can implement these steps in MATLAB:

1. **Define and plot the original signal**:
   ```matlab
   fs = 5000; % original sampling rate
   t = 0:1/fs:1-1/fs; % time vector for 1 second
   x = sin(2*pi*200*t) + cos(2*pi*2000*t);
   ```

2. **Resample the signal**:
   ```matlab
   fs_new = 6250; % new sampling rate
   [p, q] = rat(fs_new / fs); % rational approximation for resampling
   x_resampled = resample(x, p, q);
   ```

3. **Design and apply the low-pass filter**:
   ```matlab
   f_cutoff = 1000; % cutoff frequency
   [b, a] = butter(6, f_cutoff/(fs_new/2)); % 6th order Butterworth filter
   x_filtered = filter(b, a, x_resampled);
   ```

4. **Analyze and plot results**:
   ```matlab
   subplot(3,1,1);
   plot(t, x);
   title('Original Signal');

   t_resampled = 0:1/fs_new:1-1/fs_new;
   subplot(3,1,2);
   plot(t_resampled, x_resampled);
   title('Resampled Signal');

   subplot(3,1,3);
   plot(t_resampled, x_filtered);
   title('Filtered Signal');
   ```

This will help you visualize the steps and the effects of each processing stage on the signal.
